<p class="fl B">Vicken has been the chair of Manchester Pride and set up Many Mirrors in 2016. He lives in Cheshire and is a practising member of the Armenian Church. Vicken has kindly answered a few questions to give an insight into his journey and identity as an LGBT person of faith.</p>

<p class="B">What is it like being out as an LGBTQ+ person and being part of a religious community?</p>

<p>Life can be difficult enough for an LGBTQ+ person with all the associated problems that this can bring. If we add having a religious faith into the mix, then things get a lot more complicated. I have had quite a journey of my own coming from an Orthodox Christian background with its traditional values and for many years compartmentalised my Christian community life away from my LGBT life and especially my voluntary work including being the former Chair of Manchester Pride.</p>

<p>However, thanks to the example set by a former Bishop of the UK Armenian community, a local Armenian priest and some incredible progressive thinking people in my community, I was able slowly to reconcile my sexuality with my faith. I now feel much more at home in my community and am in fact getting more involved in Church life (I am a trustee of the Armenian Church in Manchester and a trainee sub-deacon!). I believe that we all have a personal relationship with God and that He loves us unconditionally.</p>

<p>Through my LGBT Interfaith group Many Mirrors I have met many amazing people of differing faiths who have been (or are) on similar journeys to my own and it is so wonderful to be able to share experiences and give each other support and friendship when it is needed. It has opened up a new world to me!</p>

<p class="B">What do you wish someone had told you before coming out as L, G, B, T, Q+?</p>

<p>That it is okay to be who you are and (I know it sounds a bit corny) that you are not alone even if sometimes it feels like it.</p>

<p class="B">What has been your most positive experience since coming out?</p>

<p>Being accepted by a whole community and making friends who wonit judge me and who will stand by me whatever happens. While I was Chair of Manchester Pride, I met many hundreds of people from all walks of life and it has been a great privilege to get to know them and to learn about their experiences.</p>

<p class="B">What advice would you give to anyone facing difficulties as a result of their sexual orientation or gender identity?</p>

<p>Try and find some kind of support whether it is from supportive family members, friends or on line. There are safe support networks out there, don't feel alone.</p>
